**SkillAegis-Editor** is a platform to design exercise scenarios, enhancing skills in applications like MISP and training users in best practices for information management and protective tools.

The Editor allows you to create scenarios under the [Common Exercise Format (CEXF)](https://misp.github.io/cexf/) that can be used by other application such as **[SkillAegis Dashboard](https://github.com/MISP/SkillAegis-Dashboard)**.

> [!NOTE]  
> Consider running this application with **[SkillAegis](https://github.com/MISP/SkillAegis)** for Production.
